# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting heart disease based on various health-related factors. The code utilizes logistic regression to train a model on the given heart disease dataset and evaluate its accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is loaded from the `heart.csv` file. It contains information about different health-related factors, including age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol level, and other attributes, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. Use a package manager of your choice (e.g., pip or conda) to install the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment, if you set one up.

2. Open the Jupyter notebook `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, visualization, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its accuracy.

3. Customize the analysis as needed. Feel free to modify the features used for prediction, experiment with different algorithms, or fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.

## Results

Upon executing the notebook, you will obtain the following outcomes:

- Data Exploration: The notebook includes code for exploring the heart disease dataset, such as displaying the first few rows, summary statistics, and visualizations of target distribution and attribute counts.

- Model Training and Evaluation: The notebook trains a logistic regression model on the dataset and evaluates its accuracy on both the training and testing data. The accuracy scores are displayed for each set.
